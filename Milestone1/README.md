# Milestone 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing

## Objective
To ingest fitness data from CSV/JSON files, preprocess it, normalize timestamps to UTC, and align data to a 1-minute interval.

## Dataset Source
Synthetic and public fitness datasets (heart rate, steps, sleep).

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded CSV and JSON fitness data
2. Converted timestamps to UTC format
3. Handled missing and null values
4. Resampled data to 1-minute intervals
5. Generated consolidated dataset

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Google Colab

## Output
Clean, time-aligned dataset ready for anomaly detection.
